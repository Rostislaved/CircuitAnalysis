# CircuitAnalysis

I am writting MatLab implementation of Nodal and Mesh analysis.

Function automatically decide which method will be used (the most efficient one).

Main file - Main.m.

% 1. s  - Vector of start nodes

% 2. t  - Vector of target nodes

% 3. E  - Vector of branch emf

% 4. Is - Vector of branch current (in parralel)

% 5. R  - Vector of branch resistance
